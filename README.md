# UK Tax Calculator 2023/24

Tax is complicated.
There are loads of different rules that override each other,
and different resources will differ on details.

Though I have spoken to accountants during the development
of this calculator, **I am not an accountant**.
This program was initially created to help me understand how
Salary Sacrifice works (with Income Tax and National Insurance
being a prerequisite).  
**My aim in releasing this is** to help
people to understand how tax works, **not to offer a tool for
real calculations.**
